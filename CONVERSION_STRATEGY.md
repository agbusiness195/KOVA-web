# Stele Website Conversion Strategy
## How to move visitors from “browse” to “adopt”

---

## 1. Who is on the site (and what they need)

| Audience | Primary need | Fear / objection |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Developers** (MCP, agent builders) | Easy integration, clear spec, “will this slow me down?” | Complexity, lock-in |
| **Enterprises / compliance** | Audit trail, EU AI Act, liability | “Is this credible? Who else uses it?” |
| **Investors / partners** | Traction, roadmap, team | Risk, novelty |
| **Curious technical** | “What is this?” in 10 seconds | Boredom, confusion |

**Principle:** One site can’t speak to everyone the same way. Use **one hero message** (trust layer for the agent economy) and **clear paths** so each segment finds their next step fast.

---

## 2. Psychological levers (and how we use them)

### Clarity before persuasion
- **Cognitive load:** If they don’t understand “trust layer” or “covenant” in one pass, they leave. First job: **one sentence** that sticks (“Honesty as the only rational strategy” is strong; pair it with a single concrete outcome).
- **Single clear CTA above the fold:** “Read the Spec” is good for devs; add a second path for non-devs: e.g. “Why trust matters” or “See how it works” so non-technical visitors aren’t lost.

### Problem–agitation–solution
- **Problem:** “Agents will manage trillions with no accountability.”
- **Agitation:** Don’t stop at “trust me.” Add one line that makes the cost visceral: e.g. “One breach, no proof of what was promised.”
- **Solution:** Stele = “carved in stone, verified in code.” Repeat this pattern in hero, problem section, and before CTAs.

### Authority and credibility
- **Social proof:** Logos (who’s building with Stele / who backs it), one short quote from a known name or company, “Used by X teams” or “X stars on GitHub.”
- **Specificity:** “&lt;50ms verification,” “Ed25519,” “EU AI Act” already help. Add one more concrete: e.g. “First commit: [date]” or “Spec version X” so it feels real and maintained.
- **Proof over promise:** Link to live spec, GitHub, and (if you have it) a minimal demo or diagram so “verifiable” isn’t just a word.

### Scarcity and urgency (use sparingly)
- **Soft urgency:** “EU AI Act high-risk obligations: August 2026” is perfect—real deadline, no hype.
- **Roadmap:** “Phase 1 now / Phase 2 Q2” gives a reason to engage now without sounding salesy.

### Commitment and consistency
- **Micro-commitments:** First step = “Read the Spec” or “Star on GitHub,” not “Sign a contract.” After that, “Try the quickstart” or “Join the Discord” feels natural.
- **Label the action:** “Join 500+ developers” or “Read the spec (15 min)” sets expectation and normalizes the behavior.

### Loss aversion
- **Frame the cost of inaction:** One line near the problem: “Every day without verifiable covenants is a day of unaccountable risk.” Short and factual.

### Trust and reduced friction
- **No dark patterns:** No fake countdowns or fake “X people viewing.” Trust is the product; the site must feel honest.
- **Friction:** One primary CTA per section. Two choices max (e.g. “Spec” + “GitHub”). Too many buttons = no click.
- **Risk reversal:** “Open source,” “MIT,” “No vendor lock-in” should be visible so adoption feels low-risk.

## 3. Page structure that converts

Think of the page as a funnel:

1. **Hero (5 sec)**  
   - Headline: what it is.  
   - Subline: one outcome (e.g. “Verifiable commitments for every agent”).  
   - One primary CTA (“Read the Spec”), one secondary (“See the problem”).

2. **Problem (30 sec)**  
   - Name the problem (Uncovenanted Agent).  
   - Agitate: one sentence on cost of “trust me.”  
   - End with a soft bridge: “That’s why we built Stele.”

3. **Protocol (1 min)**  
   - Inscribe → Operate → Verify.  
   - One line each; “Learn more” can go to spec.  
   - Goal: “This is rigorous and simple.”

4. **Proof (30 sec)**  
   - Code snippet (already there).  
   - One social proof block: logos, quote, or “X on GitHub.”  
   - One concrete number (latency, primitives, etc.).

5. **Differentiators (scan)**  
   - Bento grid: scannable.  
   - Each tile = one reason to believe.  
   - No need to read all; pattern should say “serious and complete.”

6. **Manifesto / quote**  
   - One memorable line.  
   - CTA: “Read the full manifesto” or “Join the conversation.”

7. **Compliance (enterprise)**  
   - EU AI Act + date.  
   - One line: “Built for compliance from day one.”

8. **Footer**  
   - Repeat: Spec, GitHub, contact.  
   - Optional: “Subscribe for updates” (low-commitment next step).

## 4. Copy and CTAs that nudge

- **Primary CTA:** Keep “Read the Spec” for devs. Consider adding context: “Read the Spec (open source)” to signal no paywall.
- **Secondary CTA:** “View on GitHub” is good. Alternative: “See how it works” → anchor to protocol or code section.
- **Above the fold:** No more than two actions. “Get started” can mean “Read the Spec” or “Star on GitHub” depending on audience; pick one as primary.
- **Section CTAs:** One per section max. E.g. after protocol: “Full protocol in the spec →”. After code: “See full API →”.
- **Verbs:** Use action verbs: Read, See, Try, Join, Star. Avoid vague “Learn more” unless paired with a specific outcome.

---

## 5. Trust and clarity (site feel)

- **Consistency:** Same tone everywhere: confident, precise, no hype. Matches “carved in stone.”
- **Transparency:** Links to spec, GitHub, license. If there’s a company behind it, “About” or “Team” (even brief) helps.
- **Accessibility:** Focus states, contrast, clear labels. Shows care and inclusivity.
- **Performance:** Fast load, no heavy video or animation that blocks content. Trust = reliability.

---

## 6. Metrics to watch (if you can)

- **Engagement:** Scroll depth, time on page, clicks on “Read the Spec” and “GitHub.”
- **Conversion:** Spec page views, GitHub stars, repo clones, (if applicable) waitlist or contact form.
- **Drop-off:** Where do people stop scrolling? That’s where to simplify or add one clear CTA.

---

## 7. Quick wins (high impact, low effort)

1. **Add one social proof element**  
   Even “Join developers building the trust layer” + GitHub star count or “X readers this month” (if you have it).

2. **One “cost of inaction” line**  
   In the problem section, one sentence that makes “doing nothing” feel risky.

3. **Single primary CTA**  
   Decide: is it “Read the Spec” or “Star on GitHub”? Make that button visually primary everywhere it appears.

4. **Spec link in nav and footer**  
   So the main conversion path is never more than one click away.

5. **One concrete “Why now”**  
   EU 2026 date is perfect. Add it near the top for compliance-minded visitors (e.g. in a small banner or first section).

6. **Reduce choices above the fold**  
   Two buttons max. Rest can be in nav or further down.

---

## 8. What “get our services” means (and how the site supports it)

If “services” = **adoption of the protocol:**

- **Awareness:** Hero + problem section.  
- **Interest:** Protocol + code + differentiators.  
- **Decision:** Social proof + compliance + “open source, no lock-in.”  
- **Action:** Read Spec → try quickstart → integrate; or Star/Share to stay in the loop.

If “services” = **commercial (consulting, enterprise):**

- Add a clear path: “For enterprises” or “Contact us” with one line (“Compliance and integration support”).
- Keep the main site about the protocol; commercial is a secondary, explicit path.

If “services” = **community (contributors, advocates):**

- CTA: “Join Discord” or “Contribute on GitHub” and one line on how they can help (e.g. “Integrations, feedback, or spec contributions”).

---

## Summary

- **One clear value proposition** and one primary CTA.
- **Problem → agitation → solution** in hero and problem section.
- **Proof:** code, numbers, one social proof block, compliance date.
- **Trust:** honest copy, open source, no dark patterns.
- **Funnel:** awareness (hero) → interest (protocol/code) → decision (proof/differentiators) → action (Spec / GitHub / contact).
- **Quick wins:** one cost-of-inaction line, one social proof element, single primary CTA, “why now” (EU 2026).

If you tell me which “service” you want to push first (spec reads, GitHub stars, enterprise contact, or community), we can turn this into concrete copy and layout changes for the live site.
